## Requirements:
1. Sacred relic sword equipped in the right hand.
2. Be able to one shot the enemies in the farming area with its golden wave ability.
3. The map needs to be at the exact zoom level as when loging in the game. So, better 
to log out and log back in to start the farming process if map zoom level was changed.
4. Ability button set to middle mouse button. If you do not want to change your settings,
you can modify the useSkill function in the script to match your mapping.

## Optional equipment:
1. Shard of Alexander: can help you achieve the one-shot enemies requirement.
2. Golden scarab: increase your rune yield.

## Farming procedure:
1. Run the script.
2. Login game.
3. Open map and teleport to Palace Approach Ledge-Road site of grace in Mohgwyn Palace. (Do not change map zoom level.)
4. Press F10.
5. Enjoy!
6. Press F10 again to pause farming. You may need to wait for it to finish one more cycle.
7. Press F8 to terminate the program. 

## Notes:
1. It may break sometimes due to a walking enemy not being one-shotted for some unknown reasons when walked to a certain position.
The cycle will continue but runes up until that point will drop. This rarely happens and did not happen at all when reached faith 80
during a 6 hour test run.
